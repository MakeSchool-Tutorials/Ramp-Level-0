## Welcome to Ramp!

We are excited to have you in the program and we look forward to helping you **ramp up** your programming skills. :)

# Assignment Formatting

As you read through the assignments here, you'll see different kinds of formats for drawing your attention to key areas.

### Learning

Along the way, important information will be highlighted in an...

# Tips for Success

How to get familiar with the program structure and get the most out of Ramp.

## Watch the Videos

Each assignment in Ramp starts with a selection of videos from [The Coding Train's p5.js Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA&v=8j0UDiN7my4).

We strongly recommend watching all of the videos at the top of each assignment to best prepare for completing the code challenges for that assignment.

The code challenges are designed to allow you to practice and extend your understanding of the concepts covered in the videos. Often, the solution to a code challenge relies upon using the same exact coding technique from one of the videos with a few small changes.

> [info]
> Note: Students who choose to tackle the code challenges without watching the videos first may spend time working on solutions that are more complicated than they need to be.
>

## Use the Walkthrough Guides

In each video, there are code examples that you may want to follow along with for greater understanding.

Under each video in the instructions will be a link to a walkthrough project that you can use to follow along with the video.

## Skim the Starter Code

At the top of each assignment instruction page will be a link for you to access the starter code. Before you start coding, it's always good to look through the project and see how much of it you already understand or to think of questions that you have that might be answered by the assignment.

Each assignment is set up like a web page, that can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the following files:

```
index.html // HTML file, web page setup (edit carefully!)
sketch.js  // JS file, where you will write your code
helpers.js // JS file, helper code (DO NOT EDIT)
```

The majority of your code will be added to `sketch.js`.

> [info]
> In some assignments there will be code in a `helper.js` file that helps make the program more beginner friendly but that you don't need to interact with directly. Feel free to look at the contents, but please **do not** make edits there.
>

## Read Instructions Carefully

Complete all of the challenges in each assignment by **reading the directions carefully** and checking that both your code and the end result meet all of the requirements as given.

## Use the Documentation

All of the assignments in Ramp are written in Javascript (JS) and use the `p5.js` library, which provides useful code features packaged together for convenient use.

All of the available `p5.js` functions and features are described in the documentation at [http://p5js.org/reference/](http://p5js.org/reference/). Click on the name of a function to see examples and explanations of how to use it.

Check out this [helpful guide to using documentation](https://medium.com/@faith.chikwekwe/how-to-use-documentation-a-review-of-the-p5-js-reference-manual-and-the-mdn-docs-861912eeaa61), written by a former Make School student.

## Check Your Work

Like in science experiments where you form a hypothesis, run an experiment, and then evaluate the results - programmers can follow a similar pattern to help check their work as they go:

- Think about what changes you expect to occur with your recently added code. (hypothesis)
- Run your program, and pay attention to the output or results. (experiment)
- Did the program run as you expected? If not, what was different from what you expected? What clue might that give you about how your code can be improved? (evaluate)

## Getting Help and Feedback

What if you are stuck?

Read tips in [How to Ask for Coding Help for Beginners](https://medium.com/make-school/how-to-ask-for-coding-help-for-beginners-16362ae97dc6), written by a former Make School student.

As a Ramp participant, we also have a few options for getting help from members of the Make School community, listed below.

### Get Help on Discord

Join the Make School Online Learning Community Discord by visiting [https://make.sc/join-discord](https://make.sc/join-discord).

Once you've joined the Make School Discord community, you can post a question in the `#ramp-support` channel to get peer support. Our community mentors won't give you the exact answers, but are always happy to help you get back on track! :)

### Attend Office Hours

Office hours are hosted by volunteer mentors and dependent on volunteer availability. Upcoming office hour times will be shared in the `#ramp-support` channel on Discord.

## Completing Assignments

Once you are finished with an assignment you can share a link to your finished project to `#ramp-support` on Slack to request a peer review for feedback or tips to further improve your code.

> [info]
> Note: Peer reviews are all done by volunteers and there is no guarantee of how long it may take to get a reply (though we hope not long!). There is no need to wait for feedback before moving on to the next assignment if you feel ready!

## Other Questions

Email [ramp@makeschool.com](mailto:ramp@makeschool.com) for any other questions you have.

Good luck, and happy coding as you tackle your first code challenges in the next section! :)
